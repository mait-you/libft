# LIBFT

LIBFT is a foundational project at 42 School that involves creating a custom C library. It provides essential functions that mimic or extend standard C library functionality, which you can reuse in your future projects.

## Overview

LIBFT is your very own library of C functions, built from scratch, to enhance your programming toolkit. It covers:
- Reimplementation of standard C library functions (e.g., `strlen`, `strcpy`).
- Additional utility functions for memory, strings, and linked lists.
- The foundation for many future projects in 42 School.

This project helps you understand:
- Memory allocation and management.
- String manipulation.
- Data structures like linked lists.

## Functions Implemented

### Part 1: Standard Library Functions
Reimplementations of standard libc functions:
